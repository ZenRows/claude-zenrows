description: First-run setup and troubleshooting for the Zenrows plugin in Claude. Use when the plugin was just installed, a Zenrows tool is missing or "not available", Zenrows returns a 401 or an AUTH error, the connector needs sign-in, or the user asks whether Zenrows is set up. Not for normal scraping tasks once the plugin works (use scrape-webpage).

# Getting started

Run the checks below. Do the work; do not just print instructions. The Zenrows connector signs in with OAuth, so there is no API key to set.

## 1. Probe the connection

First confirm the Zenrows tools (`scrape`, `browser_*`) are available in this session.

- Tools missing entirely: Zenrows is not connected yet. Tell the user how to connect it:
  - In Claude (web or desktop): open **Settings → Connectors**, find **Zenrows**, choose **Connect**, sign in to Zenrows and approve access.
  - In Claude Code: run `/mcp`, select the `zenrows` server and choose **Authenticate**, then sign in to Zenrows in the browser.
- Tools present: call `scrape(url='https://httpbin.io/get', response_type='plaintext')` and branch:
  - 200 with a body: Zenrows is working. Go to step 2.
  - 401, or an `AUTH` error: the sign-in is missing or expired. Ask the user to reconnect Zenrows the same way as above, then retry. Do not ask for an API key.

## 2. First successful scrape

Run `scrape(url='https://www.scrapingcourse.com/ecommerce/', response_type='markdown')` and show the user the first 10 lines. This confirms the full path works.

## 3. Where to go next

Offer three copy-ready prompts:

- "Fetch the docs at <url> and summarize the key points."
- "Get all the product names and prices from <url>."
- "Map the URLs on <host>."

## Notes

- A Zenrows account is required. New users can sign up during the sign-in step.
- Error-code reference: search the code (for example `AUTH002` or `REQS002`) at https://docs.zenrows.com.
- Once Zenrows works, hand normal tasks to the capability skills: `scrape-webpage`, `extract-structured-data`, `batch`, `crawl`, `map`, `browser-automation`, `capture-api-calls`.
